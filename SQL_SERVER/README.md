To run The Server
1. Make sure the correct port/ip is set in launchSettings.json according to what device/network your on
2. cd into SQL_SERVER the path should end with SQL_SERVER/SQL_SERVER

3. type: dotnet run (if you built the project already dotnet build etc.. )_

*** ofc you need to have all the dependencies installed before doing all of this steps

the result will look like:
